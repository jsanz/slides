## Agenda

* **CARTO**: from consultancy to start-up
* **Evolution** of the solutions engineering team

---

## Origins in consultancy

* **Consultancy** firm started by @jatorre and @saleiva in 2008
* Focus on **biodiversity**
* Many projects with **geospatial** component
* Some R&D funded projects
* Using **only FOSS4G** software
* Few people, **fast** and **frictionless** development

---

## CartoDB

* Always the same **geospatial stack** (postgis + mapnik)
* Convert that stack into a **product**
* Offer it as a **freemium SaaS**
* Enter the start-up life cycle
* Released at late 2011

---

## 2011-2013

---

## How we do sales engineering?

* **Clear process** for Sales Reps to ask for help
* Only **after qualification**: don’t get into the opportunity too soon
* An SE is assigned for the full opportunity process
* **Work closely** with the Sals Rep., listen client recommendations, help on the best sales approach, asure CARTO is a good fit
* Develop proofs of concept and tailored demos

---

## How we do support?

* **Strong asynchronous** focus: no phone, no chat, only e-mail to attend even our own workmates
* Synchronous communications (chat or phone) only for **urgent** stuff
  * *Planes falling from sky*
  * *Most of our MRR may be in jeopardy*
* Internally we use:
  * **Chat**: slack
  * **Audio/video**: slack, google meet, goto meeting/webinar, whatever fancies our clients and our hipster sales people (*Skype for what?*)

---

## How we do support?

* Inputs:
  * Mostly attending our **ticketing system**
  * But also **GIS Stack Exchange** `carto` tag
  * And **Google Group** (but this is normally attended by Engineering folks)
* Using **GitHub Issues** to pass tasks between us over timezones and communicate with our developers

---

## How we do support?

Recently Engineering has developed a new procedure called **Response Team** (sort of *Teddy Bear v2*) where a group of engineers rotates every two weeks to focus only on helping to **fix issues** raised by us (and by proxy the full company).

---

## Conclusions

As we grew...

* we needed more procedures
* we needed to be mindful of our communication channels
* we pursued to be more specific in our roles
* we need to improve our onboarding
* we need to be more resilient to team changes
